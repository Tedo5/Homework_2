                A computer scientist is a person who has acquired the knowledge
                of computer science, the study of the theoretical foundations
                of information and computation and their application.

                Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer was the first 
                programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer made 
                in 1945.There were other computers that had these features,
                but the <a href="../index.html"> ENIAC </a> had all of them in one package. It was Turing-complete
                and able to solve "a large class of numerical problems" through reprogramming.
